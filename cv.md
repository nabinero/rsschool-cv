## Summary

My goal here is self-development. I have a chance to try something new, and I will take it - my personal qualities, such as productivity and responsibility, will help me to do so. I'm always open to new suggestions and move forward with a passion for learning and innovation.

## Code

var countSheep = function (num) {
  let sheep = '';
  for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
    sheep += ${i} sheep...;
  }
  return sheep;
}
